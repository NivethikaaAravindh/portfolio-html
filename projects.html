<h1>PROJECT WORKS</h1>

<h2>TITLE: MECHANIZED VALVE CONTROLLER USING ARDUINO</h2>
<p>In this system, the sensors (Infra-red) will sense the entry
    and exit of an object and automatically opens the outlet valve. This project
    mainly concentrates on water management system. This helps to reduce the
    wastage of water in public managements.</p>
<h2>TITLE: SMART WATER METER USING IoT</h2>
<p>This system helps in finding the water theft happening in
    the locals, in this the water is been monitored using flow meter and
    microcontroller ,that datas are stored in iot,when there is a change in flow
    the solenoid valve will automatically get closed.</p>
